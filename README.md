# Green Hell VR website DEMO

Hey i'm thalium, here is a proposition for an optimized website for [GHVR](https://greenhellvr.com/).
I'm using for this project 4 languages :
- HTML
- SCSS
- CSS
- JS

The SCSS is an easier way to write CSS files, then the SCSS file is recompiled (translated) into a .css file.

*Please respect my work and don't stole it (except if you work for Incuvo), i would appreciate it!*

## Checklist
- [X] Getting >95% of [performance](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) for PC and >80% for phones
- [x] Cross-platform (phone compatible)
- [x] Respect the initial design
- [ ] Split the navbar to be used anywhere
- [ ] split the CSS file to allow async loading and to also use the navbar anywhere else
- [ ] Create Multi-resolutions images for low bandwidth
- [ ] Finished
- [ ] Published xD

I also want to use the less JS i can for peaple who don't have JS enabled.  
*( I may have stolen ~~all the~~ some images from the official website, sorry ;P )*
